A Go Percolator base.

Traditionally search engines search many documents with one query. A Percolator runs many queries against one document
and acts on the matched query/queries.

**Note:** It is likely more useful to integrate the percolator code directly into your codebase. This is not written
to be used as a library, but rather as an example.
